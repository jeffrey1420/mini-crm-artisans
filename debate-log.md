## Debate 19: Landing Page — Simplicity-First vs ROI-First

**Challenge:** Previous Position A (ROI/emotional hook) swung toward "Vos clients vous payent en 48h" and emotional pain framing. Product Strategist challenges this assumption.

### Product Strategist — Simplicity-First Case

**Core argument:** ROI framing invites skepticism and comparison shopping. "Gagnez 2h/semaine" triggers mental calculation: *"Est-ce que je perds vraiment 2h par semaine?"* — you've started a sales conversation you can't win on a landing page. You're attracting analytical buyers who will comparison-shop, not sign up today.

**Why simplicity-first wins the acquisition funnel:**
1. "Simple comme WhatsApp" kills the real objection (fear of learning new software) before it forms
2. It selects for early adopters without asking them to admit they're early adopters
3. Simplicity creates conditions for the ROI story to write itself — inside the product, not on the landing page
4. The best SaaS onboarding is one where the user discovers value themselves. Over-promise ROI on landing page + 15-minute setup = broken contract

**Proposed headline + subheadline:**
> **Headline:** Vos devis et factures, sans vous prendre la tête.
>
> **Subheadline:** Pas de formation. Pas de tableau comparatif. Vous envoyez votre premier devis en 5 minutes, depuis votre téléphone.

**Rationale:** "Sans vous prendre la tête" = WhatsApp signal in plain French. Addresses cognitive ease, not feature power. "Pas de formation. Pas de tableau comparatif." attacks competitor comparison fear. "Depuis votre téléphone" = mobile-first reassurance. Zero ROI promises — the value prop is friction removal.

**Verdict on U3/U6:** RESOLVED — Simplicity-first wins. U3 = Simplicity framing. U6 = headline above.

## Debate 20: Home View — A Third Option

**Challenge:** Both Dashboard-first and Timeline-first are solving the wrong problem. Technical Architect challenges both premises.

### Technical Architect — Job-First Home View

**Core argument:** Both sides assume the home view is about organizing administrative work. Dashboard-first = "what admin tasks are overdue?" (project manager thinking). Timeline-first = "what happened with this client?" (CRM thinking). Neither addresses the actual cognitive state of an artisan at 7:30 AM before heading to a job site.

**The third option — Active Job Card as Home Anchor:**

The home view should answer one question: *"What am I working on right now?"*

The UI renders a single **Active Job Card** containing:
- Job title and address (the physical location he's going to)
- Client name and phone (one-tap call)
- Job type and description (quick context refresh)
- Today's plan/notes
- Status indicator (en cours, en pause, pending materials)
- Quick actions: Mark complete, Add note, View quote, View invoice

Below: **Upcoming Jobs Strip** (next 3 jobs by scheduled date) + **Quick stats bar** (de-emphasized counts for devis en attente / factures impayées that he can tap but aren't surfaced as alarms)

**Why "what job am I working on right now" beats "what admin tasks are overdue":**
1. Dashboard-first surfaces administrative anxiety during work time — when Marc needs to stay focused on the physical task
2. The mental model mismatch: Dashboard assumes Marc's primary job is managing his business. It isn't. His primary job is doing the physical work at hand.
3. Debate 16 Addendum B correctly identified guilt-driven urgency creates avoidance. But the solution isn't Timeline (passive archive). The solution is removing guilt triggers from the home view entirely. Show the job, not the admin backlog.
4. Real-world analogue: When an artisan arrives at a job site, they don't check voicemail and see outstanding invoices. They look at their work order and notes. The app should replicate this.

**Data model implications:**
- `jobs` table needs `status` (pending / in_progress / completed), `scheduled_date`, `updated_at`
- Home query: most recently updated `in_progress` job, or most recent `pending` with today's scheduled date
- Single-tenant: no multi-user complications at launch

**Verdict on U4:** RESOLVED — Job-first home view. Dashboard cards move to secondary "À suivre" tab.

## Debate 21: E-Invoicing — Regulatory Pressure ≠ Launch Urgency

**Challenge:** Previous debate treated U5 as a technical question (2-3 sprints vs 6-8 sprints). Growth Strategist reframes it as a go-to-market question.

### Growth Strategist — v2 E-Invoicing Case

**Core argument:** Regulatory pressure ≠ buy-side urgency at launch. The 2026 mandate requires artisans to RECEIVE e-invoices (the sender bears the obligation). The artisan can receive via: Chorus Pro portal (free), a free tier of any PEPPOL-accessible tool, or their accounting software. The outbound e-invoicing obligation (sending) comes later and phases in by company size.

**Why Day 1 e-invoicing is a positioning trap:**
1. Clean MVP pitch: "Create professional devis and invoices in minutes. Get paid faster." E-invoicing at launch adds compliance narrative that: confuses core value prop, makes us look like we're building for B2B SaaS accountants, introduces fear/urgency framing that creates friction in trial sign-up
2. We want desire, not fear, at top of funnel
3. Provider lock-in before product-market fit: committing to Factea or Tebilis before we understand our own users means we can't evaluate which provider truly serves our users' needs

**Why v2 is better growth:**
1. Learn user behavior first: in 30-day trial window, what matters for conversion is devis creation speed, whether artisans understand customization, whether facture → relance flow reduces pain, whether they trust us. E-invoicing onboarding adds complexity without visible value until they're already habituated
2. Clean acquisition funnel: "Gagnez 2h/semaine" attracts the wrong buyer. Positioning around compliance attracts the wrong buyer too — someone who sees this as a compliance tool, not a daily workflow tool
3. The regulatory deadline is real but the urgency is for large companies sending to artisans — not for the artisan evaluating a devis/facture tool for their own workflow

**U2 framework (for when we do e-invoicing in v2):**
- API quality: REST preferred, clear docs, sandbox environment
- Compliance scope: Must support Peppol/PEPPOL access for French e-invoicing mandate
- Pricing: Per-invoice or flat monthly, artisan-friendly (< €15/month for solo)
- Integration complexity: Must be embeddable in Nuxt flow without redirecting to external portal
- Candidates: Factea (has API + Peppol, good dev docs), Tebilis (similar, slightly cheaper), Archipelia (more accounting-focused, less artisan-native)
- Recommendation: Evaluate Factea first — best API docs, already Peppol-connected, solo artisan pricing

**Verdict on U5:** RESOLVED — v2 e-invoicing. Decision D8 stands.

## Debate 22: Relances as Differentiator — Fragile Assumption

**Challenge:** Product Vision claims "relances (follow-ups they don't have to chase manually)" is the key differentiator. Product Strategist challenges this assumption.

### Product Strategist — Relances-Should-Be-De-Emphasized Case

**Core argument:** "Relances automatiques" solves for the wrong pain. Artisans don't hate following up — they hate forgetting to, or feeling awkward doing it. Those are different problems requiring different solutions.

**Why relances-as-differentiator is fragile:**
1. **French artisan culture is direct.** They call, not text. An automated WhatsApp message from a business tool feels cold and risks the personal client relationship they've built over years.
2. **"I don't have to chase" is the wrong promise.** Most artisans want to stay on top of it — the mental load is remembering *who* and *when*, not the act itself. Automated reminders don't solve remembering.
3. **WhatsApp reminders feel impersonal to the client.** A French client receiving "Votre facture de 850€ est en attente depuis 30 jours" from a business tool may wonder if the artisan even cares enough to call personally.
4. **Attracts the wrong users.** Hooking on relances automation attracts: cash-flow-challenged artisans, those with poor client relationships, people who want to outsource the awkward part. These are churn risks, not ideal customers.
5. **Competitors don't lead with it.** Tolteck and Obat lead with job management and scheduling — if relances were a massive purchase driver, they'd have capitalized on it.

**Proposed reframing:** "Votre administration ne vous ralentit plus" / "Restez professionnel du devis au paiement." Frame: from "we do the uncomfortable thing for you" to "you stay in control of your business, end to end."

**Product Strategist POSITION:** Relances should be DE-EMPHASIZED on the landing page (kept as feature, not headline). Frame relances as "schedule a follow-up reminder for yourself" (not "we text your client"). Better differentiation: "Everything in one place: clients, jobs, invoices, follow-ups — no spreadsheet required."

**Verdict on U3 (landing page hero):** REOPENED — Product Strategist challenges U3 resolution. Relances should not appear in the headline. "Simplicité" still wins, but relances should be removed from hero framing entirely.

## Debate 23: Trial Length — 30 Days Is Too Long

**Challenge:** D6 (30-day trial) treated as resolved. Growth Strategist challenges: 30 days creates procrastination, not conversion.

### Growth Strategist — 14-Day Trial Case

**Core argument:** 30 days assumes organic user engagement and eventual conversion. This is fantasy for a French artisan persona (busy, not browsing, acute-need buyer).

**Why 30 days hurts conversion:**
1. **Days 1-7:** Good intentions. Days 8-14: vaguely remember signing up. Days 15-22: guilt, avoidance. Days 23-30: panic, convert out of guilt or let it expire. The trial expired but value was never demonstrated.
2. **Urgency drives action.** Shorter trials force a decision. Every session matters. 30 days creates "I'll get to it eventually." 14 days creates real pressure.
3. **Self-selection.** 30 days attracts curious browsers and competitive researchers. 14 days self-selects for people with an acute need NOW.
4. **The GTM doc says 14 days, debate log says 30 days.** This conflict must be resolved.
5. **Industry data:** Studies consistently show 14-21 day trials matching or beating 30-day trials on conversion rates.

**On credit card at signup:** For MVP stage, no credit card at signup — friction kills conversion at awareness stage. Compensate with aggressive email drip (trial ending in 7 days, 3 days, 1 day). Credit card capture can be introduced at day 7-10 for engaged users.

**Growth Strategist POSITION:** Trial should be **14 days**, no credit card at signup, email drip creating 3 touchpoints in the final week.

**Verdict on D6:** REOPENED — 30-day trial should be changed to 14-day trial.

## Debate 24: PWA-First — Wrong Strategy for This Audience

**Challenge:** D11 (PWA first, native within 6 months). Technical Architect challenges that PWA-first is the wrong mobile strategy for a French artisan CRM.

### Technical Architect — React Native from Day 1 Case

**Core argument:** PWAs work for apps where reach > engagement > conversion. A B2B CRM where reminders are the core product requires reliable push notifications, App Store credibility, and hardware access that PWAs can't guarantee — especially on iOS.

**Why PWA-first fails for this audience:**
1. **Marc is Android-heavy, but Android PWA install rate is under 15%.** "Add to Home Screen" is a hidden, alien action for this demographic.
2. **iOS PWAs are hobbled.** Apple restricts background execution, caps storage at 50MB, and does not support web push reliably. ~40% of French users on iOS = broken reminder system for large portion of users.
3. **Push notifications ARE the product.** This is a CRM. Relances and reminders are the core value. Web push on iOS simply doesn't work. If Marc misses a notification, the app has failed its core job.
4. **Trust signal for financial tools.** App Store presence = credibility. A "website added to home screen" doesn't feel like a professional business tool for a 45-55 year old.
5. **"6-month native" timeline is a lie.** Maintaining two separate codebases, retraining users twice, feature parity nightmares. The pivot rarely happens cleanly.
6. **Hardware access.** Camera for receipts, file system for PDFs, background processing — PWAs have ceilings that native doesn't.

**Technical Architect POSITION:** Mobile strategy should be **React Native from Day 1** — single codebase covers both platforms, push notifications work from Day 1, App Store presence from launch, no "6-month pivot" fantasy.

**Verdict on D11:** REOPENED — PWA-first should be reconsidered. React Native from Day 1 is the stronger position for this specific audience and product.
